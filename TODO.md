- show log labels
- timeline view:
  - show log count as bars; vertical gap between zero and one is stretched to make it more evident
    that that time bin has logs present
    - could breakout log count by log level; something for the future
  - histogram needs to be better
  - show separate histogram for filtered content
- search bar buttons too big
- when switching sort order the left/right verticalindicators are swapped until they are repainted
- color scheme dropdown is overflowing
- autoconvert first datetime format to the user's timezone? will be finicky
- test maxLineLength, maxRenderableRows
- is applyFontSizeVars using the correct font?
- are there unused CSS classes
- warning message if series errors
  - exclamation-triangle
